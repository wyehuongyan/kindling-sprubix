Inspired by (but unrelated to) [Periscope](https://www.periscope.tv)'s permission control, PermissionScope is a Swift framework for intelligently requesting permissions from users.

The default view and an example of customization done for [treat](https://gettre.at)

We should all be more careful about when we request permissions from users, opting to request them only when they're needed and definitely not all in one barrage when the user opens the app for the first time.

PermissionScope gives you space to explain your reasons for requesting their precious permissions and allows users to tackle the system dialogs at their own pace. It conforms to (what I hope will be) a standard permissions design but is flexible enough to fit in to most UIKit-based apps.

Best of all, PermissionScope detects when ([some of](https://github.com/nickoneill/PermissionScope/issues/9)) your permissions have been denied by a user and gives them an easy prompt to go into the system settings page to modify these permissions.

## installation

* requires iOS 8+

Installation for [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is simple enough:

`github "nickoneill/PermissionScope"`

As for [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org), use this to get the latest code:

`pod 'PermissionScope', '~> 0.6'`

And `import PermissionScope` in the files you'd like to use it.

No promises that it works with Obj-C at the moment, I'm using it with a mostly-Swift codebase. Feedback on this would be great though.

## usage

The simplest implementation displays a list of permissions and is removed when all of them have satisfactory access.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    let pscope = PermissionScope()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        pscope.addPermission(PermissionConfig(type: .Contacts, demands: .Required, message: "We use this to steal\r\nyour friends"))
        pscope.addPermission(PermissionConfig(type: .Notifications, demands: .Optional, message: "We use this to send you\r\nspam and love notes", notificationCategories: .None))
        pscope.addPermission(PermissionConfig(type: .LocationInUse, demands: .Required, message: "We use this to track\r\nwhere you live"))

        pscope.show()
    }

    @IBAction func doAThing() {
        pscope.show(authChange: { (finished, results) -> Void in
            println("got results \(results)")
        }, cancelled: { (results) -> Void in
            println("thing was cancelled")
        })
    }
}
```

The permissions view will automatically show if there are permissions to approve and will take no action if permissions are already granted. It will automatically hide when all permissions have been approved.

If you're attempting to block access to a screen in your app without permissions (like, say, the broadcast screen in Periscope), you should watch for the cancel closure and take an appropriate action for your app.

A permission can either have `.Required` or .`Optional` demands. Required permissions (such as access to contacts for a contact picker) are evaluated when you call `show` and, if all required demands are met, the dialog isn't shown!

A permission with the `.Optional` demand will not cause the dialog to show alone. Users who have accepted all the required permissions but not all optional permissions can tap out to continue without allowing the optional permissions.

### customizability

You can easily change the colors, label and buttons fonts with PermissionScope.

```swift
pscope.tintColor = UIColor...
pscope.headerLabel.text = "..."
pscope.headerLabel.font = UIFont...
pscope.bodyLabel.text = "..."
pscope.bodyLabel.font = UIFont...
pscope.buttonFont = UIFont...
pscope.labelFont = UIFont...
```

In addition, the default behavior for tapping the background behind the dialog is to cancel the dialog (which calls the cancel closure you can provide on `show`). You can change this behavior with `backgroundTapCancels` during init.

### issues

* You get "Library not loaded: @rpath/libswiftCoreAudio.dylib", "image not found" errors when your app runs:

PermissionScope imports CoreAudio to request microphone access but it's not automatically linked in if your app doesn't `import CoreAudio` somewhere. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a a quirk of how CoreAudio is imported. For now, if you `import CoreAudio` in your top level project it should fix the issue.

### beta
We're using PermissionScope in [treat](https://gettre.at) and fixing issues as they arise. Still, there's definitely some beta-ness around. Check out what we have planned in [issues](http://github.com/nickoneill/PermissionScope/issues) and contribute a suggestion or some code üòÉ

### PermissionScope registers user notification settings, not remote notifications
Users will get the prompt to enable notifications when using PermissionScope but it's up to you to watch for results in your app delegate's `didRegisterUserNotificationSettings` and then register for remote notifications independently. This won't alert the user again. You're still responsible for handling the shipment of user notification settings off to your push server.

### notes about location
**You must set these Info.plist keys for location to work**

Trickiest part of implementing location permissions? You must implement the proper key in your Info.plist file with a short description of how your app uses location info (shown in the system permissions dialog). Without this, trying to get location  permissions will just silently fail. *Software*!

Use `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` or `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` where appropriate for your app usage. You can specify which of these location permissions you wish to request with `.LocationAlways` or `.LocationInUse` while configuring PermissionScope.

### license, etc

PermissionScope uses the MIT license. Please file an issue if you have any questions or if you'd like to share how you're using this tool. Thanks!
